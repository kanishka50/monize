# Dispatch the six-configuration experiment, STRICTLY ONE RUN AT A TIME.
#
# Two properties this script exists to guarantee:
#   1. SERIAL EXECUTION. Concurrent runs would share GitHub's infrastructure
#      and contaminate each other's measurements, so each run is watched to
#      completion before the next is dispatched.
#   2. RANDOMISED ORDER FROM A FIXED SEED. In a fixed A,B,C,D,E,F order any drift
#      in GitHub's runner fleet over the collection window would align with
#      configuration and be indistinguishable from a treatment effect. The
#      order is shuffled, and the seed is recorded so the schedule reproduces.
#
# Usage:  bash experiment/run-pilot.sh [REPLICATES] [SEED] [CONFIGS] [SKIP]
#         bash experiment/run-pilot.sh 2 20260920          # 2 of each: 12 runs
#         bash experiment/run-pilot.sh 1 20260920 "C E"    # validate two configs
#         bash experiment/run-pilot.sh 9 20260922 "A B C D E F" 9  # resume after run 9
