# Dispatch the CONFIRMATORY round (methodology Decision 12).
#
# Differs from run-pilot.sh (the exploratory dispatcher) in one respect: every
# run is dispatched with required_cpu, so a job on any other processor cancels
# its own run at the first step (the "Processor gate"). Such a run measured
# nothing; it is logged as REJECTED and the same schedule entry is sent again,
# until KEEP runs per configuration have completed on the required processor.
#
#   - Runs of one subject are still serial, in a shuffled order from a seed.
#   - The four subjects may run at the same time: separate repositories, and
#     every job gets its own fresh machine.
#   - A real failure (not a rejection) is logged and counted, never hidden. The
#     entry is re-sent; after MAX_FAIL failures the script stops for a look.
#   - Resumable: re-run with the same arguments; runs already in kept-runs.csv
#     are not repeated.
#
# Output (experiment/data/confirmatory/, kept apart from exploratory data):
#   kept-runs.csv   config,run_id of every completed, accepted run
#   attempts.csv    every dispatch and its outcome (kept / rejected / failed)
#
